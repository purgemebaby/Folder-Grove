__Folder Grove__ is a CLI Bash script that allows you to create, save and load presets of your project's folder structure. The main purpose of Folder Grove is to make the setup of your applications, scripts, exploits or whatever you want to cook faster. The executable here is projecTF.sh

Running this script will display a menu in the CLI with 5 options:

1) __Default Project Structures__: I made some examples of project structures following established standards for the corresponding language/purpose (this may not be the project structure you are searching for). In any other case, you can change this in the script or add more.

2) __Create Non-Persistent Structured Project__: This allows you to make the main folders and subfolders of your project structure at your working directory/custom path, but does not saving this as a preset. (While coding, I couldn't get this one able to create subfiles).

3) __Create Persistent Structured Project (custom path not available)__: With this option you can save a preset in a <name>.txt located at the fg_presets folder created when you run the script.

4) __Load Custom Structured Project__: If you made a preset, you can load it at your working directory/custom path.

5) __Exit__: Bai Bai! :(

__Note__: This script it's a "for fun" project because I wanted to learn some Bash Scripting, so may have bugs or be very limited for serious business.
